Step 1. DCi Responses

Code to Calculate DCi Diff we are using.

this will export a file for phylogentic analyses: Species_DCiDiff_newtrts.csv
this will also export a file for the mixed model trait analyses: Species_DCiDiff_formixedmodels.csv

Phylogentic Analyses.
Step 1. Tree_ring

this will trim a tree for all the species that will be used and to remove non vascular plants

This exports:
scorre.tree.win.los.tre
Species_DCiDiff_newtrts_filtered.csv

Step 2. Phylosig script

run this and store the funciton to determine significant clades

Step 3. DCi_Clades

this creates all the trees with labeled nodes that are significant.
